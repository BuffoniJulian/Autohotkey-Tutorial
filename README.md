## Why AutoHotkey Will Change Your Digital Life Forever

Imagine if you could bend your computer to your will, automate mind-numbing tasks, and become a productivity ninja with just a few lines of code. That's exactly what AutoHotkey (AHK) lets you do! ü•∑

### What is AutoHotkey?

AutoHotkey is a scripting language that allows you to:
- Easily automate repetitive tasks
- Create custom hotkeys and shortcuts
- Manipulate windows, text, and more
- Save HOURS of your precious time

## Let's Dive into an Epic AHK Script! üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### 1. Basic Setup and Includes

```autohotkey
#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0

```

**Why This Matters:**
- `#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0`: Ensures you're using the right version

#### 1.1. What I usually use

```autohotkey
#Warn All, Off
SendMode("Input")  
SetWorkingDir(A_ScriptDir)  
#SingleInstance Force
```
- `#Warn All, Off`: Enables all warning dialogs, but then immediately turns them off. In development, you might want to set this to #Warn to catch potential script issues.
- `SendMode("Input")`: Provides faster, more reliable keyboard input
- `#SingleInstance Force`: Automatically replaces the previous script version when you reload

### 2. Productivity Hotkeys üöÄ

```autohotkey
; Minimize current window
#^Down:: WinMinimize "A"


; Navigation Shortcuts
!^Down:: SendInput("^{END}")
!^UP:: SendInput("^{HOME}")
```

**Power Move Breakdown:**
- `!^Down` (Alt + Ctrl + Down): Jumps to the end of the document
Uses *Ctrl + End* key combination
- `!^UP` (Alt + Ctrl + Up): Jumps to the beginning of the document
Uses *Ctrl + Home* key combination

### 3. Text Manipulation Magic ‚ú®

```autohotkey
; Delete entire line left or right
^+Backspace:: {
    SendInput("+{Home}")
    SendInput("{Delete}")
}

^+!Backspace:: {
    SendInput("+{End}")
    SendInput("{Delete}")
}
```

**Coding Superpowers Explained:**
These keyboard shortcuts let you quickly delete text from the cursor to either the start or the end of the line without needing your mouse:

*Ctrl + Shift + Backspace*
Deletes all text to the left of the cursor (from the cursor to the beginning of the line).
    Example:
        Cursor here ‚Üí `Hello |world`
        Press *Ctrl + Shift + Backspace*
        Result: `|world`

*Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Backspace*
Deletes all text to the right of the cursor (from the cursor to the end of the line).
    Example:
        Cursor here ‚Üí `Hello| world`
        Press *Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Backspace*
        Result: `Hello|`

#### 3.1. Why this is magical:

- **Speed & Efficiency**: Forget about dragging your mouse or repeatedly pressing backspace or delete. These shortcuts handle entire chunks of text in one go.
- **Perfect for Coding**: If you often need to clear parts of a line in code editors, these shortcuts save time when refactoring or editing.
- **Universal Use**: Works in any text field, editor, or IDE where you write and edit text.

### 4. Personal Data Shortcuts ü§ñ

```autohotkey
; Quick Personal Info Expansion
:o::id::12345678910
:o::email1::my_email@domain.com
:o::email2::my_email2@domain.com
```

**Efficiency Unlocked:**
- Type `:id` and BAM! Your id number appears
- Quickly fill forms or send repetitive info with shortcuts for emails, phone numbers, and more.
- To expand a snippet, simply type the keyword (e.g., :email1) and watch it auto-complete.

### 5. Date Wizardry üìÖ

```autohotkey
:*::hoy:: {
    CurrentDateTime := FormatTime(, "yyyy-MM-dd")
    SendInput(CurrentDateTime)
}

:*::nhoy::
{
    CurrentDateTime := FormatTime(, "dd-MM-yyy")
    SendInput(CurrentDateTime)
    return
}


:*::ayer:: {
    today := a_now
    today := DateAdd(today, -1, 'days')
    today := FormatTime(today, "yyyy-MM-dd")
    SendInput(today)
}
```

**Time Travel (Sort Of):**
- `:hoy` instantly types today's date. (Hoy means Today in spanish)
- `:ayer` magically inserts yesterday's date(Ayer means Yesterday in spanish)
- Never manually type dates again!


#### Time Travel Expanded
Here are examples of what each shortcut produces:

- **ISO Dates (yyyy-MM-dd)**:
    :hoy ‚Üí 2024-11-29 (Today's date)
- **Localized Dates (dd-MM-yyyy)**:
    :nhoy ‚Üí 29-11-2024 (Today's date)
- **Time (HH:mm)**:
    :hora ‚Üí 14:45 (Current system time)

##### Why use these formats?
- `yyyy-MM-dd`: Perfect for databases, APIs, or when consistency across systems is required.
- `dd-MM-yyyy`: User-friendly for regions like Europe or Latin America where this format is common.
- `HH:mm`: Quick time insertion for logs or messages.

### 6. Application-Specific Hotkeys üéØ

```autohotkey
#HotIf WinActive("Notepad++ ahk_exe notepad++.exe")
~^s:: {
    Reload()
    return
}
#HotIf
```

**Context is King:**
- These hotkeys only work in specific applications
- In Notepad++, *Ctrl + S* now reloads your script
- Tailored automation for each app!

### 7. Reloading is your lord and savior ‚≠ê

The `~+^r:: Reload()` hotkey is a developer's best friend when working with AutoHotkey scripts. Here's why it's incredibly useful:
Why You Want the Reload Hotkey
Imagine you're in the middle of working on your computer, and you've just made a small tweak to your AutoHotkey script. Without this hotkey, you'd have to:

1. Stop the current script manually
2. Find the script file
3. Double-click to restart it

With `~+^r:: Reload()`, you can:

- Instantly update your script mid-workflow
- Test changes without interrupting your current work
- Save time during script development
- Maintain a seamless productivity experience

**Real-world scenario**: You're coding and realize you want to add a new hotkey or fix a small bug. Instead of breaking your concentration, you simply press *Shift + Ctrl + R*, and your script updates instantly - with zero downtime.
It's like having a instant "refresh" button for your custom computer automation. The ~ ensures the original key combination still works (so *Shift + Ctrl + R* can still do its original function in most apps), while also triggering the script reload.
This single line of code represents the core of AHK's power: **rapid, flexible customization** of your computing environment.

### 8. Language and Math Shortcuts üåê‚ûï

#### 8.5 Contextual Typing Exclusions üõ°Ô∏è

```autohotkey
#HotIf NOT (WinActive("ahk_class SunAwtFrame") or WinActive("SQL") or 
            WinActive("Visual Studio Code") or WinActive("Azure") or 
            WinActive("ahk_exe datagrip64.exe") or 
            WinActive("ahk_exe FSD-WinGDK-Shipping.exe"))
```

This configuration ensures hotkeys are disabled when certain applications are active. It prevents interference with your workflow in environments like coding, database management, or gaming.

##### Key Details:
- **`#HotIf`**: Creates conditional hotkeys based on window context.
- **`NOT`**: Disables hotkeys when the conditions inside the parentheses are met.
- **`WinActive()`**: Checks if a specific window is currently active.
  - **`ahk_class`**: Identifies windows by their internal class names.
  - **`ahk_exe`**: Targets applications by their executable names.
  - Text like "SQL" matches partial window titles.

For example:
- **`ahk_class SunAwtFrame`**: Often Java-based apps like IntelliJ.
- **`ahk_exe datagrip64.exe`**: Refers to DataGrip, a database IDE.
- **`FSD-WinGDK-Shipping.exe`**: Likely a game executable.

By excluding these applications, hotkeys stay relevant only where they‚Äôre needed.

---

#### Using AutoHotkey Window Spy üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To identify window titles, class names, or executables, follow these steps:

1. **Open Window Spy**:
   - Launch **Window Spy** from your AutoHotkey installation folder, or run it from an AHK script:
     ```autohotkey
     Run, WindowSpy.ahk
     ```

2. **Activate the Target Application**:
   - Switch to the application you want to analyze and ensure its window is active.

3. **Review Window Spy Output**:
   Key details are displayed:
   - **Window Title**: The full title of the current window.
   - **Class Name**: Shown as `ahk_class [Class Name]`, e.g., `ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1`.
   - **Executable Name**: Shown as `ahk_exe [Executable Name]`, e.g., `ahk_exe Code.exe`.

4. **Choose the Identifier**:
   - Use `ahk_exe` for precision (e.g., `datagrip64.exe`).
   - Use `ahk_class` for broader matches across similar windows.
   - Use partial titles for specific windows if necessary (e.g., `"SQL"`).

5. **Apply in Your Script**:
   Example of disabling hotkeys for Visual Studio Code:
   ```autohotkey
   #HotIf NOT WinActive("ahk_exe Code.exe")
   ```

---

This method ensures accurate targeting of windows, preventing unwanted hotkey interference while maintaining efficiency across your workflows.

#### 8.6 Bonus: Quick Text Corrections üîß

Automatic corrections for common typos and accented words:

| Typo         | Correction   |
|--------------|--------------|
| `nomina`     | `n√≥mina`     |
| `preambulo`  | `pre√°mbulo`  |
| `semantica`  | `sem√°ntica`  |
| `implicita`  | `impl√≠cita`  |
